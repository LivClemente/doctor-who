	<h1>My Doctor Who Website</h1>
	<h2>Tom Baker</h2>
	<p><img src="../Images/doctors/Tom-Baker-source_horrorcultfilms.co_.uk_.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">The Fourth Doctor is the fourth incarnation of the protagonist of the  long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was portrayed  by Tom Baker for seven consecutive seasons and remains the longest-lived  incarnation of the Doctor in the show's on-screen history, counting both the  classic and modern series. Further to this, he is considered to be the most  recognisable incarnations of the Doctor both in the United Kingdom and internationally.<br><br />
	  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord  alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS,  frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate  his body, changing his physical appearance and personality in the process.  Baker portrays the fourth such incarnation, a whimsical and sometimes brooding  individual whose enormous personal warmth is at times tempered by his capacity  for righteous anger. His initial companion was intrepid journalist Sarah Jane  Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), who had travelled alongside him in his previous  incarnation, and she is later joined by surgeon Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter).  His later companions included robotic dog K-9, savage alien warrior Leela  (Louise Jameson), female Time Lord Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), alien  aristocrat Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), boy genius Adric (Matthew Waterhouse) and  Australian flight attendant Tegan (Janet Fielding).</p><br />
