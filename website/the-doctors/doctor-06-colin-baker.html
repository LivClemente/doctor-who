<h1>My Doctor Who Website</h1>
<h2>Colin Baker</h2>
<p><img src="../Images/doctors/colin-baker-sixth-doctor-6th.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">The Sixth Doctor is the sixth incarnation of the protagonist of the  long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was portrayed  by Colin Baker. Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively  brief and turbulent, Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish's  range of original Doctor Who audio adventures. Within the series' narrative,  the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who  travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the  Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his  physical appearance and personality change. Baker portrays the sixth such  incarnation, a flamboyant man in brightly coloured, mismatched clothes whose  brash and overbearing personality set him apart from all his previous  incarnations, at times hearkening back to the early irascibility and initial undertones  of untrustworthiness of the First Doctor.</p>
