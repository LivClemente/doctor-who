	<h1>My Doctor Who Website

	<h2>Jon Pertwee </h2>
	<p>The Third Doctor is the third incarnation of the protagonist of the  long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was portrayed  by actor Jon Pertwee.<br><br />
	  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord  alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS,  frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, his body can  regenerate; as a result, his physical appearance and personality change.  Pertwee portrays the third such incarnation, a dapper man of action of stark  contrast to his wily but less action-oriented predecessors. While previous  Doctors' stories had all involved time and space travel, for production reasons  Pertwee's stories initially depicted the Doctor stranded on Earth, where he  worked as a scientific advisor to the supernatural paramilitary group UNIT. His  adventures often fitted into the spy-fi genre which had been popularised by The  Avengers the decade prior. Within the story, the Third Doctor came into  existence as part of a punishment from his own race, the Time Lords, who forced  him to regenerate and also disabled his TARDIS. Eventually, this restriction is  lifted and the Third Doctor embarks on more traditional time travel and space  exploration stories.<br><br />
	  His initial companion is UNIT scientist Liz Shaw (Caroline John), who  unceremoniously leaves the Doctor's company between episodes to be replaced by  the more wide-eyed Jo Grant (Katy Manning), who then continues to accompany the  Doctor after he regains use of his TARDIS. His final companion was intrepid  journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), who would go on to become the  Doctor's longest-serving companion.</p><br />
