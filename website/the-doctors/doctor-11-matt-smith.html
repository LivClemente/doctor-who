<h1>My Doctor Who Website </h1>
<h2>Matt Smith</h2>
<p>The Eleventh Doctor is the eleventh incarnation of the protagonist of  the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is played by Matt  Smith,[9] who appears in three series as well as seven specials, over an almost  four-year period. As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character  has also appeared in other Doctor Who multimedia.<br><br />
  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien, a  Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in time and space in his  TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he  can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and  with it, a distinct new personality. Smith portrays the eleventh such  incarnation, a quick-tempered but compassionate man whose youthful appearance  is at odds with his more discerning and world-weary temperament. His main  companions included feisty Scot Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), her husband Rory  Williams (Arthur Darvill) and the mysterious Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman).  He also frequently appeared alongside River Song (Alex Kingston), a fellow time  traveller with whom he shared a romantic storyline, and was the last Doctor to  appear alongside the long-serving companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen)  prior to the actress' death, featuring in two episodes of the spin-off  programme The Sarah Jane Adventures.<br><br />
  After the end of the revived series' seventh season in May 2013, Smith  announced he was leaving the show, but would portray the character in two more  episodes. He is slated to appear in The Day of the Doctor, the show's 50th  anniversary special, on 23 November 2013, and the following month's Christmas  special, in which Peter Capaldi will take over the role as the Twelfth Doctor.</p><br />
