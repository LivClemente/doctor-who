<h1>My Doctor Who Website</h1>
<h2>Paul McGann</h2><br />
<p><img src="../Images/doctors/paul-mcgann-doctor-who.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">The Eighth Doctor is the eighth incarnation of the protagonist of the  long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was portrayed  by Paul McGann. Though he only appeared on television in one 1996 TV film, his  adventures are extensively portrayed in other media in the years which followed  it. McGann then reprised the role in a 2013 mini-episode called &quot;The Night  of the Doctor&quot;, which depicts the last adventure of the Eighth Doctor and  his regeneration.<br><br />
  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien, a  Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in time and space in his  TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he  can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and  with it, a distinct new personality. McGann portrays the eighth such  incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only  companion in the television movie is Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook), a  medical doctor whose surgery is responsible for triggering his regeneration. In  the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and  comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including  self-styled &quot;Edwardian Adventuress&quot; Charley, the alien Destrii and  present-day humans Lucie and Sam.</p><br .>
