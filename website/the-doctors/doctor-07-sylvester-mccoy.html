<h1>My Doctor Who Website</h1>
<h2>Sylvester McCoy</h2>
<p>The Seventh Doctor is the seventh incarnation of the protagonist of the  long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was portrayed  by the actor Sylvester McCoy.<br><br />
  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord  alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS,  frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can  regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality  change. McCoy portrays the seventh such incarnation, a whimsical, thoughtful  character who quickly becomes more layered, secretive, and manipulative. His  first companion was Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford), a computer programmer who  travelled with his previous incarnation, and who is soon succeeded by troubled  teenager and explosives expert Ace (Sophie Aldred), who becomes his protégée.<br><br />
  The Seventh Doctor first appeared on TV in 1987. After the programme was  cancelled at the end of 1989, the Seventh Doctor's adventures continued in  novels until the late 1990s. The Seventh Doctor made an appearance at the start  of the 1996 movie before the character was replaced by the Eighth Doctor.</p><br />
