	<h1>The First Doctor</h1>
	<h2>William Hartnell	</h2>
	<p><img src="../Images/doctors/the-first-doctor.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">The First Doctor has been characterised as a crotchety old man but he was so much more, displaying childish delight, great charm, enormous warmth and a wonderful sense of mischief during his many adventures through time and space</p>
	<p>he First Doctor is the initial incarnation of the protagonist of the  long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was portrayed  by the actor William Hartnell from 1963 to 1966. Hartnell reprised the role in  the tenth anniversary story The Three Doctors in 1973 â€“ albeit in a reduced  capacity due to his ailing health. In 1983, actor Richard Hurndall played the  part of the First Doctor in the 20th anniversary story The Five Doctors, as  William Hartnell had died in 1975. A cinematic version of the character, Dr.  Who, was played by Peter Cushing.<br><br />
	  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time  Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS,  frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can  regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality  change. Hartnell's Doctor is the Doctor's &quot;original&quot; form. The  regeneration plot device was introduced when Hartnell needed to leave the  series, and consequently has extended the life of the show for many years. The  First Doctor is the youngest incarnation of the Doctor, but has the most aged  physical appearance, having grown old through a natural lifespan. The Doctor's  ability to regenerate allows him to appear younger, effectively taking on a new  body that has yet to wear down with age. Respectively, later incarnations would  portray the Doctor with a younger appearance, though his natural age continues to rise.</p><br />
