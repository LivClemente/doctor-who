<h2>River Song</h2>
<p><img src="../Images/Campanions/356216-s4_08_river_song.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">River Song is a fictional character created by Steven Moffat and played  by Alex Kingston in the British science-fiction series Doctor Who. River Song  was introduced to the series as an experienced future companion of series  protagonist the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time in his  TARDIS. Because River Song is a time traveller herself, her adventures with the  Doctor occur out of synchronisation; their first meeting (from the audience's  perspective) is his first and apparently her last. In later appearances, River  is a companion of the Doctor in his eleventh incarnation, portrayed by Matt Smith.  River Song was created by Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat for the show's fourth  series in 2008, under the tenure of executive producer Russell T Davies. When  Moffat took over Davies' duties as executive producer, he began expanding on  the character's background, depicting adventures earlier in River's timeline,  upgrading Alex Kingston from a guest star to a recurring actor in the series.  Other actresses have subsequently portrayed younger versions of the character.<br><br />
  When the character was first introduced, much about her origins remained  a mystery. Following the character's initial appearance, Davies had described  her as &quot;one of the most important characters&quot; in the narrative, and  &quot;vital&quot; to the Doctor's life. In series six (2011), Moffat's  episodes unveil more about the character. Born Melody Pond, River is the  daughter of the Eleventh Doctor's companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory  Williams (Arthur Darvill), alongside whom Kingston had appeared several times  in series five (2010). Having been conceived on board the TARDIS as it  travelled through the space-time vortex, Melody is born with genetic traits and  abilities similar to the Doctor's own race, the Time Lords.</p>
