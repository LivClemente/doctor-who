<h1>My Doctor Who Website </h1>
<h2>Martha Jones</h2>
<p>Martha Jones is a fictional character played by Freema Agyeman in the  long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who and its  spin-off series, Torchwood. She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor in Doctor  Who, replacing Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). According to the character's creator  and executive producer Russell T Davies in his non-fiction book Doctor Who: The  Writer's Tale, the character was developed from the beginning with the  intention of appearing for a whole of the 2007 series, and to later make guest  appearances in subsequent series and crossover appearances in the show's two  spin-offs; Martha subsequently made guest appearances in Torchwood series two  and in Doctor Who series four in 2008 and special episode The End of Time in  2010. Martha was also intended to make guest appearances in the 2009 series of  Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures, but could not due to the actress'  other obligations.<br><br />
  Within the series' narrative, Martha begins as a medical student who  becomes the Doctor's time travelling companion after an incident at the  hospital where she works. After well over a year (from the perspective of the  Doctor and herself) of service at the Doctor's side, Martha parts from the  Doctor's company as she cannot bear her own unrequited love for him. After  returning to life on Earth, becoming engaged and finishing her medical degree,  Martha finds a newfound level of independence when she is recruited into the  paranormal military organisations UNIT, and briefly Torchwood. Having faced the  end of the world single-handedly during her time with the Doctor, Martha is  recognised for her skills both in the field and in medicine.</p><br />
