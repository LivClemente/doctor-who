<h2>Amy Pond</h2>
<p><img src="../Images/Campanions/Amy-Pond-doctor-who-22245586-495-715.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">Amelia Jessica &quot;Amy&quot; Pond is a fictional character portrayed  by Karen Gillan in the long-running British science fiction television series  Doctor Who. Amy is a companion of the series protagonist the Doctor, in his  eleventh incarnation, played by Matt Smith. She appears in the programme from  the fifth series (2010) to midway through the seventh series (2012).<br><br />
  The Doctor first meets Amelia when she is seven years old and disturbed  by a crack in her wall (that is actually one of several cracks in the  universe). He promises to return to the lonely girl in 5 minutes and take her  with him in his time and space machine the TARDIS, but accidentally arrives  twelve years later, by which time Amy has become skeptical about her  &quot;imaginary friend&quot;. However, she eventually decides to travel with  him, and the duo are later joined by her fiance Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill).  Amy and Rory marry at the end of the fifth series and in the sixth series Amy  gives birth to their daughter, Melody Pond, who is revealed to be recurring  character River Song (Alex Kingston).</p><br />
