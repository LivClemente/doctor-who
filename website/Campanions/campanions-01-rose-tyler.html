<h1>My Doctor Who Website </h1>
<h2>Rose Tyler</h2>
<p><img src="../Images/Campanions/Rose-Tyler-Season-4-Wallpaper-rose-tyler-1655636-1024-768.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="">Rose Tyler is a fictional character portrayed by Billie Piper in the  long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who, and was  created by series producer Russell T Davies. With the revival of Doctor Who in  2005, Rose was introduced in the eponymous series one premiere as a new  companion of series protagonist the Doctor, in his ninth and tenth  incarnations. The companion character, intended to act as an audience  surrogate, was key in the first series more so than any other to introduce new  viewers to Doctor Who, which had not aired regularly since 1989. The series saw  Billie Piper receive top billing alongside Christopher Eccleston and David  Tennant, both of whom portrayed the Doctor. A regular companion of the Doctor  for all of series one and series two, Rose also returned in the programme's  fourth series having developed into a harder character.<br><br />
  In the series' narrative, Rose is introduced as a 19-year-old working  class shop assistant from London,  alongside her own supporting cast in the form of her mother Jackie Tyler  (Camille Coduri) and her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke). Over the course  of the first series Rose's human actions and responses contrast with the  Doctor's alien perspectives. He comes to value and depend on her and sacrifices  his Ninth incarnation for her. Rose grows increasingly trusting of the new  Doctor and comes to realise she has fallen in love with him. The two appear to  be forever separated in the 2006 series two finale, although Rose eventually  made a temporary return late in the fourth series in which her relationship to  the Doctor is given resolution.<br><br />
  In promoting the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic  characteristics whilst Davies highlighted her down to earth qualities and  quintessential Britishness. Critical reaction noted that the character was more  developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had  been, whilst the character's overall role in the narrative of the first two  series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more  mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose —including two  National Television Awards —and since her initial role in the series has ranked  highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular,  Piper experienced success in other high profile roles as an actress which has  been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.</p><br />
