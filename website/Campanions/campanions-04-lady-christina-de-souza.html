<h1>My Doctor Who Website </h1>
<h2>Lady Christina de Souza</h2>
<p><img src="../Images/Campanions/Lady_Christina_de_Souza.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=""></p>
<p>Lady Christina de Souza was a friend of the Tenth and  Eleventh Doctors, and had brief adventures with them both. A minor member of  the British aristocracy, she was also a thief and an adrenaline junkie. Her  exploits were well-publicized — at least in Britain — allowing Rory Williams to  recognize her on sight.<br><br />
  Christina was  fiercely independent and enjoyed defying the Doctor's wishes. She was an expert  thief, but only stole for the adrenaline rush. She was bored by her  aristocratic life and had a high opinion of herself. She used her obvious  charms and good looks to win people over, often for selfish reasons. She showed  great enthusiasm for joining the Doctor on his travels, but quickly forgave him  when he refused. She could also speak French fluently, which amused the Doctor.  She had an untrustworthy streak in her; she abandoned her partner in crime, who  was probably also her lover, when he was caught by guards during her escape  from the museum. Despite that, she was kind enough to give the cup over to save  lives, though also to save her.</p><br />
