<h1>My Doctor Who Website </h1>
<h2>Cyberman</h2>
<p>The Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs who are amongst the most  persistent enemies of the Doctor in the British science fiction television  programme, Doctor Who. Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of  humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more  and more artificial parts into their bodies as a means of self-preservation.  This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating, with every  emotion deleted from their minds.<br><br />
  They were created by Dr. Kit Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor  to the show) and Gerry Davis in 1966, first appearing in the serial The Tenth  Planet, the last to feature William Hartnell as the First Doctor. They have  since been featured numerous times in their extreme attempts to survive through  conquest up until the show was cancelled.<br><br />
  Following the revival of the show, the Cybermen returned as a parallel  universe version and appeared in the 2006 series' two-part story, &quot;Rise of  the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;, and have been recurring  villains in the revived series since. A further redesign took place in the 2013  episode &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;, showing technologically advanced  Cybermen able to instantly upgrade themselves to fix flaws and weaknesses. They  also appeared in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood in its fourth episode,  &quot;Cyberwoman&quot; (2006). Cybermen have also appeared in 2010 installments  of the Doctor Who video game series The Adventure Games.</p><br />
